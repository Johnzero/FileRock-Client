    RFC 2315: PKCS#7 page 21
    Some content-encryption algorithms assume the
    input length is a multiple of k octets, where k > 1, and
    let the application define a method for handling inputs
    whose lengths are not a multiple of k octets. For such
    algorithms, the method shall be to pad the input at the
    trailing end with k - (l mod k) octets all having value k -
    (l mod k), where l is the length of the input. In other
    words, the input is padded at the trailing end with one of
    the following strings:

             01 -- if l mod k = k-1
            02 02 -- if l mod k = k-2
                        .
                        .
                        .
          k k ... k k -- if l mod k = 0

    The padding can be removed unambiguously since all input is
    padded and no padding string is a suffix of another. This
    padding method is well-defined if and only if k < 256;
    methods for larger k are an open issue for further study.
