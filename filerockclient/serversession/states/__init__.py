Reification of the states of the client-server communication protocol.

This package contains the implementation of the states for ServerSession's
state machine. The set of all states is partitioned into python modules,
one for each "logical phase" of a session:

* Pre-authentication
* Startup Synchronization
* Replication and Transfer
* Commit
* Basis Mismatch (data integrity error)

A state is a singleton instance of a subclass of the abstract
ServerSessionState class (which is in the "abstract" module). The
StateRegister class in the "register" module acts as the register for
these singletons.
