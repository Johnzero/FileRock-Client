The content of this package controls the communication with the server
and the internal execution of the client.

ServerSession is the intelligent part of the client application. It
is implemented as an event-loop machine, receiving events from many
sources: the user, ServerSession itself, other application
components and the server, each with a different priority level. It
decides, for example, when to handle operations for synchronizing
data and when to answer to messages from the server, thus
implementing the communication protocol.

For more details see server_session, which is the main module.
